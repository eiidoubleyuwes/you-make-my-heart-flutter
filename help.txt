This is a file I'm creating to take notes within the file

First of all,to use images in the project

	1. Navigate to the home page of your server and create a folder for the images ie barakambuguaon.top/student/images/
	2. Add the name of the file in the database ie baraka.png
	3. In your flutter code add the file path and attach to the URL ie barakambuguaon.top/student/images/${studentcontroller.studentList[index].image}
